# Media Files for GitHub Repos

Contains a collection of media files used in the README.md files of my GitHub repositories.

Include them into markdown files with the following syntax:
```markdown
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddebenedittis/media/main/control_quadrupeds_soft_contacts/anymal_c-trot-grass.webp)
```
Or with this syntax if you want to resize the image:
```markdown
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddebenedittis/media/main/control_quadrupeds_soft_contacts/anymal_c-trot-grass.webp" width="400">
```
